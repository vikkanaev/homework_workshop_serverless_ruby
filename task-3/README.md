## Setup & Test

This project is built for [GitHub Codespcaes](https://github.com/features/codespaces) using the [Development Container](https://containers.dev) specification. Once you have the repo cloned and setup with a dev container using either Codespaces or [VS Code](#using-vs-code), run the following commands. This will install packages and run tests.

```shell
$ ./bin/setup
$ ./bin/test
```

#### Using VS Code

If you have the [Visual Studio Code Dev Container](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed you can easily clone this repo locally, use the "Open Folder in Container..." command. This allows you to use the integrated terminal for the commands above.

## Next Steps

- Deploy it. Read the Lamby [Quick Start](https://lamby.cloud/docs/quick_start) guide for details.
- Provide a new value for the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` or other environment variables using our [Environment & Configuration](https://lamby.cloud/docs/environment_and_configuration) guides.
